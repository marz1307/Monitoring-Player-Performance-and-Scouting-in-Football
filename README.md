### Big data Analytics: Using Big data Analytics in Tracking Player Performance and Scouting in Football.
---

#### Purpose of study

There is a vast amount of data available, and the main objective of this study is to examine how this data can interpreted to coaches and scouts when following player performance and recruiting. For that reason, the scope of the research is set to rank and recommend talents. With ranking talents, we mean rating players across leagues using performance data specific to be able to give advice or make recommendations on talent recruitment. In addition, we also study relevant academic contributions towards the use of big data analytics in football and the respective used fields: tracking player performance and scouting.

#### Hypotheses

With the enormous success of data analytics in other sports and the success stories of football clubs who have adopted it, most teams are exploring ways to use data to their advantage, particularly when it comes to identifying players to strengthen their ranks. We also stated that the goal of this study is to compare talents. As a result, the research question is as follows; How can big data analytics help scout, and coaches track player performance and make better recruitment decisions? Because the data is restricted, the focus is on how we can answer the research question with it.
The following three sub-questions will be answered to answer the primary research
question:
- What data preparation is required before the data analytics process can begin?
- How can coaches and scouts be helped in their search for the finest athletes?
- How should the information be presented to the scouts and coaches?
  
Before valuable information can be found in the data, Q1 is the technique that needs to be adopted. The second question concerns what information can be extracted to find the best players and how players can be monitored and scouted. We will find a technique of providing the essential information to the many stakeholders by answering Q3.

#### Data

The data consist of five national European competitions in the 2017/2018 season namely: Spanish Laliga, Italian Serie A, English Premier League, German Bundesliga, and French Ligue Un. These competitions are the topmost ranked in Europe based on the UEFA country coefficients, which is used to rank the European football associations and determine the number of clubs from an association that will participate in the UEFA Champions league, UEFA Europa league and the UEFA Conference league[https://www.uefa.com/nationalassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2023](https://www.uefa.com/nationalassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2023).

Furthermore, data from the Euroâ€™s 2016 and 2018 World Cup which are national team competitions are included. The total datasets provided are seven matching information about all teams, competitions, matches, events, players, coaches, and
referees. The dataset was released under the CC BY 4.0 License and publicly available on figshare (Pappalardo et al., 2019). This was used alongside the PlayerRank dataset which contains number of goals scored and average player rating.
